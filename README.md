## How to use it?

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run dev`
3. project will automatically open in your browser
4. to **view it on mobile**, after running `npm install` look for the **Network** address in the console.
5. run `npm run build` to build for deployment. This will also create `stats.html` file which is a **Rollup Visualizer** that we can open in any browser
6. `npm run preview` to locally preview the production build

7. `npm run test` to run vitest
8. `npm run coverage` to generate coverage report

## Texture size

The biggest files are textures. If faster performance is needed, you can easily reduce the quality of texture images for faster load.

- `preparation` for easy loading and implementation:

  - **model loading** - takes compressed and normal version (.glb),
  - **texture loading** - add any texture (diffuse, AO...),
  - **environment map loading**
  - **assets preloading** - assets like model, texture, hdr... are preloaded so that app starts quicker
